2.3 Blast Mechanic

The Blast Mechanic is shaped based on the grid information entered through the editor. Using this data, the boxes in the generated grid become destructible if there are at least two or more in a row. 
To help the player find them more easily, there is a hint algorithm consisting of 3 states. If the boxes are aligned with fewer than 5, no action is triggered. If there are between 4 and 7, state A is activated; 
between 6 and 9, state B is triggered; and if there are more than 8, state C is activated. In these states, each color has its own unique sprite, making it easier for the player to spot the boxes. 
The objective of this mechanic is to reach a predetermined score. The way to collect points is by exploding the boxes found in states A, B, and C.
